NLP, GPT-2 e HuggingFace

Hugging Face is doing an amazing job to the open source community. They pre trained the PyTorch implementation of OpenAI GPT-2 and released at the PyTorch Hub (https://pytorch.org/hub).

Also, they made available a free service where you can type any sentence and GPT-2 will suggest 3 sentences to complete it. It is available at https://transformer.huggingface.co

How it was done you may ask? They made a post detailing the technical stuff, especially how they scaled thousands of requests on a single 4-GPU machine with low response times: https://medium.com/huggingface/scaling-a-massive-state-of-the-art-deep-learning-model-in-production-8277c5652d5f
