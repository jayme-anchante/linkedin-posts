🤖 🤖  INTERPRETABLE NEURAL NETS 🤖 🤖

Ever wondered what a neural network is composed of?? 🤔🤔🤔

A neural networks is a collection of nodes (circles in the plot). Each connection (arrows in the plot) can transmit a signal from one node to another. A node that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional nodes connected to it.

In Deep Learning, the signal is a real number, also known as weights (numbers in black in the plot) and biases (numbers in blue in the plot). The node is an artificial neuron - something like the neurons in our brains. Neurons are typically aggregated into layers (a column of neurons in the plot)

x1, x2 and x3 are the inputs to our artificial neural network - composed of 3 layers - and y is the output

BTW, I used the neuralnet R package for the plot and the mtcars data for feeding it :)

NN are less threatening? Enjoyed the explanation? Give it a 👍👍👍
