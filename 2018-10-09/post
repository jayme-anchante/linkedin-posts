~~ PAUL ROMER, NOBEL üèÜ & DATA SCIENCE ~~

Paul Romer has just been announced co-winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics

He is an advocate of reproducible science, when he couldn't share his methodology with his students because he was using closed-source Mathematica by Wolfram Research, he turned to open-source Jupyter Notebooks for sharing his research. Some (like James Somers in https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) go even further in saying that Jupyter Notebooks might even replace the traditional research paper shared as a PDF

He is also a 62-year-old economist who is a user of the Python programming language! Probably the most widely used language for Data Science, along with R and Julia
