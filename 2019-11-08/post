GPT-2 1.5B release

@openai finally released the final 1.5 billion parameters model weights and code

There is still a long way to go through, but GPT2 is beginning to get more credibility from humans, especially compared to the other GPT2 versions

In terms of performance, the 1.B accuracy on the test set is 96% compared to the small 124M model's 79.3%
