~~ CatBoost ~~

CatBoost (https://catboost.ai/) is a fantastic machine learning framework open sourced by Yandex (https://yandex.com/).

It is based on gradient boosting over decision trees, just like LightGBM (https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM), XGBoost (https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), scikit-learn's Gradient Boosting (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting)

Its features includes:

* Support for both numerical and categorical features
* Fast GPU and multi-GPU support for training
* Data visualization tools included
