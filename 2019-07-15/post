Classifying Legendary Pokemon Birds

After only the second fastai "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" class I was able to complete an end-to-end deep learning project! ğŸ¤–ğŸ¤–ğŸ¤–

The main goal is to classify an image as either one of the Legendary Pokemon Birds - Articuno, Moltres or Zapdos - or an alternative class which includes everything else. Needless to say that sometimes my model gets confused about the alternative class since not so many diverse images were feed into it...
