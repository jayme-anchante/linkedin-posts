parameter optimization with tensorflow and tensorboard


model: convolutional neural network

dataset: cat vs dogs Kaggle competition by Microsoft


obs1: thanks Harrison Kinsley for the amazing tutorial!

obs2: keras has an cuDNN optimized LSTM called tf.keras.layers.CuDNNLSTM. It was 10 times faster than regular tf.keras.layers.LSTM. Both ran on tensorflow-gpu on a GTX 1080
