~~ a game changer in AI ~~




The Tsetlin Machine is a simple and versatile learning mechanism that uses Nash equilibria and propositional formulas that provide optimal pattern recognition accuracy.

(Incredible) Main features: it always finds global optima, outperforms many models (neural nets, random forests, SVMs and others), the accuracy advantage increases with lack of data, it is less computationally intensive and highly interpretable
