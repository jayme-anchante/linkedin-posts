~~ data scince, planning poker and the wisdom of the crowd ~~


At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth, 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of an ox. Francis Galton observed that the median guess (1207 pounds) near missed the true weight (1198 pounds)

The wisdom of the crowd is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert

The crowd usually outperforms the expert due to the elimination of random errors that affect each person's answer (if the individual judgments are independent/diverse)

Planning poker is a technique for estimating the effort of software development. Estimates are only revealed after everyone chose their cards (to ensure independence)

The estimation process is repeated until consensus is reached, however, estimates average at any round should make a better prediction than the estimate of the developer who is likely to own the deliverable
