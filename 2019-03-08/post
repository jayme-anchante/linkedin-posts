UPs 'n DOWNs of the week

up: TinyTeX is awesome, lightweight and simple instructions to get it going, plus you can manage it from R

down: IJulia is so hard to get working, environments created after it was installed failed, the local julia conda environment failed, various docker images failed...

What were your UPs and DOWNs??
